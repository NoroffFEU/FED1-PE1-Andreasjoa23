# FED1 Project Exam 1
Welcome to MovieNight, an exciting exam project designed to enhance your movie-watching experience!

## Description
MovieNight is my first coding exam. The goal was to use design, html, css and JS to create a full functional webpage where users with admin privilage could create/update and delete posts on the website. 
And non-users being able to view the content on the webpage. 

## The Team

## Key Features:
* A home page with a carousel function that show the three latest posts and a list of atleast 12 blogposts.
* A public page where the user can see the specific blog page.
* A edit page where the user can edit or delete a already created blog post.
* A create page where the user can create a new blogpost.
* A account register page where a user can register an account without admin privilage

## Project info
  ### Goal
  To put into practice the skills you have learned over the FED1 program. 
  You will demonstrate your ability to interpret a brief, plan your solution, design a user interface, build and test a responsive web application. 
  You will be required to use all of the skills that you have learned this year including design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  ### Brief
  You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. 
  The client has asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. 
  The client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts. 
  During testing, you will use your own account that you create to act as the owner.
  
 ### What I used for my website:
  1. https://film-grab.com/ For my pictures URL and downloaded
  2. Canva.com For my Logo. 
  3. FontAwesome for Icons.
  4. The Prefix function, that has been helped by a fellow student to accomplish by showing how she did it and learning me.
